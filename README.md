## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Atakan Topcu.



ðŸ‘€ Currently, Iâ€™m interested in the unsupervised deep learning methods for variety of clinical diffusion MRI applications along with both hardware and software realization of Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI)/Magnetic Particle Spectroscopy (MPS).

:monocle_face: If I got the chance, I would also like to work with other imaging modalities such as Fourier ptychography or cryo-EM.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently pursuing my Master's degree at Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey.
